        <p class="govuk-body">Talk to your line manager, or someone else if you’d prefer - for example, someone from the HR department or another manager. Arrange a meeting with them so you won’t be disturbed.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You can ask if someone can go to the meeting with you if you don’t feel able to go on your own. This could be a friend, colleague or your union rep. Your employer doesn’t have to agree to this, though.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">At the meeting, tell your employer what you’re unhappy about and ask them about the reasons for their actions.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Tell them what you think should happen and show them any evidence you have to support your position. For example, if you didn’t get holiday pay, show them what your contract says about this and your payslips.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Keep a note of what was said at the meeting, particularly of any action your employer agrees to take. If you have someone with you at the meeting, they could take the notes for you. If your employer agrees to do something, make sure they set a date for doing it so that you can chase them if necessary.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Your notes will help if you have to take the matter further. For example, you’ll be able to use them as evidence if you raise a grievance or go to a tribunal.</p>
