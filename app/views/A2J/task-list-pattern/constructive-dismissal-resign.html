        <p class="govuk-body">Constructive dismissal can be difficult to prove so you may need more help and advice with this option.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Constructive dismissal can be on the grounds of bullying and harassment or a breaking of mutual trust and confidence.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Bullying and harrassment</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">There's an implied term in all contracts that an employer should take all reasonable steps to make sure their employees can do their job without being bullied or harassed.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Bullying is a behaviour that makes you feel intimidated or offended. Examples include:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Being treated unfairly</li>
            <li>Being regularly undermined</li>
            <li>Having malicious rumours spread about them</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Breakdown of mutual trust and confidence</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">A tribunal is likely to view a breakdown of mutual trust as a breach of contract. The kinds of actions that could lead to this inlcude threatening behaviour. </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The employer's actions don't need to be deliberate to be classed as a fundamental breach. An employment tribunal will look at whether the employer behaved in a way that way likely to seriously undermine trust and confidence.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Actions</h2>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Write a formal letter of grievance</li>
            <li>Contact ACAS to work with your employer to solve the problem</li>
            <li>Book an appointment with an adviser if you want to make an employment tribunal claim</li>
