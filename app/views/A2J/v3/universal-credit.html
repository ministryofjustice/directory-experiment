        <p class="govuk-body">We have also attached the descriptors which the DWP use to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/sick-or-disabled-people-and-carers/pip/help-with-your-claim/how-decisions-are-made">assess your eligibility to PIP and the Limited Capability Element</a>.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You will only receive an additional amount within your Universal Credit award if you are deemed to have limited capability for work and work-related activity. This is where you are deemed unable to work or do any work preparation. It amounts to an extra Â£341.92 per month. You can normally not receive this element if you have earnings that are 16 the National Minimum Wage unless you are also receiving a benefit such as PIP. Employment of a certain nature may also be indicative of fitness for work regardless of whether you receive PIP.</p>
