        <p class="govuk-body">We advised that whilst you are on sick leave, you are eligible to be furloughed. However, the decision to furlough you is at the discretion of your employer. If your employer agreed to furlough you for a period and did not pay you, this may constitute a breach of contract or unlawful deduction of wages.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">To resolve this situation, you would ordinarily start the procedure of taking your employer to a tribunal. This must be done within 3 months minus one day from the last date in the series of failures to pay you. As this deadline has passed, if you wished to recover wages owed, you would need to commence County Court action in the form of a small claim against your employer.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">We advise that you <a class="govuk-link" href="contact-an-adviser">contact us again</a> for further advice if this is something you wish to pursue further.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you cannot be furloughed due to eligibility reasons or your employer refuses to furlough you, you may be able to claim statutory sick pay.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you are sick for 4 full days or more in a row, earn on average Â£120 a week before tax and are not ineligible due to exhausting previous entitlement (received SSP for 28 weeks already which ended in the last 8 weeks) or for any of reason, you will be able to claim SSP from your employer.</p>
