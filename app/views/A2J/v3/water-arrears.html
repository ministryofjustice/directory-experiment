      <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Your water arrears is your non-priority debt</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="govuk-grid-column-two-thirds">
        <p class="govuk-body">Your non-priority debts will not affect your home, life or liberty.  However, it may affect your future availability of credit as your creditors may report non-payment of your debts to a credit reference agency.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Most lenders provide the credit reference agencies with credit account information about their customers. This includes details of the client's current or past credit commitments and your payment record. Credit account information shows whether or not payments have been made on time and, if not, how late payments were. It includes details of the account balance and whether or not the account is in default. Information about credit accounts in default is kept by the credit reference agencies for six years. Information about settled credit accounts is kept for six years from the date the credit account ended.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Your creditors could also take legal action to recover the outstanding balances on your accounts.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Collections process for non-priority debts</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">We advised you that if you default with the original terms and conditions of your agreements, a default may be placed on your credit file for 6 years and then marked as settled when paid in full. The debt could be passed on to a Debt Collection Agency to recover the balance. If no arrangement to pay is made, this could lead to a County Court Judgment (CCJ) being registered against you.</p>  
        <p class="govuk-body">A CCJ will register on your credit file and the Register of Judgments for six years.  Failing to maintain payments under a CCJ could result in further enforcement action being taken against you such as the issuance of a Warrant of Control, an Attachment of Earnings or an Information Order (to attend court for information).</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Enforcement proceedings</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">If the creditor will obtain a CCJ against you, they might be able to take action to get their money back. This is called enforcement proceedings. The creditor can usually only do this if you have broken the terms of the order - for example, if you did not make a payment on time. To start enforcement proceedings, the creditor must make an application to the court.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The creditor can use different methods of enforcement, including:</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Bailiffs</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">After judgment has been entered, if you do not comply with the order, the creditor can apply to the court for an order which allows them to take control of your goods. This means the creditor can use bailiffs to take your goods to sell and pay off the debt. You could probably make a repayment agreement instead - the agreement will be secured against the goods. This is called a ‘controlled goods agreement’.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Attachment of earnings order</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">An attachment of earnings order instructs your employer to make deductions from your earnings. They can only instruct employers to make deductions from certain types of earnings. Employers can make deductions from you’re your wages, statutory sick pay or occupational pensions in order to pay the debt.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Charging order</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">A charging order is an order securing the amount owed under a county court judgment against your interest in a property or other asset. A creditor can only apply for a charging order once the court has made a judgment for repayment of a debt.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">A charging order prevents you from selling their property without paying the money owed to the creditor. Usually charging orders are made against your beneficial interest in land, but they can also be made against other assets, such as trust funds or the surrender value of a life assurance policy.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Third party debt order</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">A third party debt order requires anyone who owes money to a debtor to pay it directly to the creditor. Third party debt orders are commonly used against a bank or building society account.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The third party debt order can only affect money actually in your account at the date on which the bank received a copy of the interim order. It does not freeze money paid in at a later date and, if the account is overdrawn on the day the order is served, the third party debt order will have no effect. There is nothing to prevent your withdrawing money from an account if you believe the creditor is going to pursue this option, but you might not know that the order has been made until seven days afterwards.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">In addition to the methods of enforcement in the paragraphs above, the following steps may be taken by the creditor:</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Order to obtain information</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">After a court order has been made, the court has the power to order you to attend court and be questioned on oath about your financial circumstances, for example, income and outgoings, property and assets. This is called an 'order to obtain information from a judgment debtor' or an 'oral examination'.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">An order to obtain information can be helpful to the creditor to decide whether it is worth pursuing enforcement action against you and, if so, which sort of action.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Bankruptcy proceedings</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">A creditor can start bankruptcy proceedings against you even if a court order has not been made. The sum owed must be more than £5,000. It is expensive for the creditor to start bankruptcy proceedings, so this approach is unlikely unless you own, or jointly own, property which could be sold to pay off the debt.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you receive a statutory demand, you must take immediate action if you want to avoid bankruptcy.</p>
