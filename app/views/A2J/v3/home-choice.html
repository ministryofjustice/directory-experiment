        <p class="govuk-body">You have completed an application for North Yorkshire Homes Choice. After your application is processed you should be allocated a banding based on your need. This determines the priority of your application. Should you be accepted, you will be able to search for and bid on properties.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You queried whether there would be any associated moving costs such as a deposit or rent in advance. We advised that this will be dependent on the landlord or Housing Association which owns the property. We advise that you contact the Homes Choice Team through Broadacres on 01609 767 900 to discuss this.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Some local authorities run a deposit bond scheme whereby they will pay the deposit on the property which is then repaid by the tenant over a period. Should you secure a property which requires a deposit you should speak to the relevant local authority about any schemes they offer.</p>
