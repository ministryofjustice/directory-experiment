            <li>You have been employed for 4 years</li>
            <li>You have no written contract of employment</li>

            <li>Company director has spoken to you to state that 'it isn't going to work'. They expressly stated that they expect you to sign a resignation letter and they will give you two weeks notice pay as a gesture of good will.</li>
